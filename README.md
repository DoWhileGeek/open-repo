# open-repo
A command line utility for opening a repositories remote homepage.

## Installation:
open-repo doesnt require any other external packages to function, so it doesnt pollute your site-packages.

`pip install open-repo`

## Usage:
`$ open-repo`

Opens a browser tab. By default it opens the 'origin' remote. Otherwise you can set the remote you want to open with:

`$ open-repo --remote alt_origin`

Open a repo thats in another directory:

`$ open-repo ../workwork`
